For example, one might anchor words like \"snow,\" \"cold,\" and \"avalanche\" to a topic if one suspects there should be a snow avalanche topic within a set of disaster relief articles.\n",

For example, one might anchor \"protest\" to three topics and \"riot\" to three other topics to understand different framings that arise from tweets about political protests.\n",

    "**Choosing anchor strength:** the anchor strength controls how much weight CorEx puts towards maximizing the mutual information between the anchor words and their respective topics. Anchor strength should always be set at a value *greater than* 1, since setting anchor strength between 0 and 1 only recovers the unsupervised CorEx objective. Empirically, setting anchor strength from 1.5-3 seems to nudge the topic model towards the anchor words. Setting anchor strength greater than 5 is strongly enforcing that the CorEx topic model find a topic associated with the anchor words.\n",

    "Our TACL paper details the theory of the CorEx topic model, its sparsity optimization, anchoring via the information bottleneck, comparisons to LDA, and anchoring experiments. The two papers from Greg Ver Steeg and Aram Galstyan develop the CorEx theory in general and provide further motivation and details of the underlying CorEx mechanisms. Hodas et al. demonstrated early CorEx topic model results and investigated an application of pointwise total correlations to quantify \"surprising\" documents.\n",
